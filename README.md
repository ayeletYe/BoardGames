# Board game creator
I build a board games platform that allows you to easily create and add a new board games 
without changing the existing code.
the code is open for extension and closed for modification.
I also build 3 different games and added to the platform:
***Four in a Row***
***TIC Tac Toe***
and ***Avalon***
every game is implemented a different logic but the 
general structure of all games is the same.
This project also takes into account the **SOLID** principles of the *OOP*.
